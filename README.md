# Ludeman-Thesis-Code
The primary code used for the prediction of runway altitude based on four points along the runway edge or two runway corners.
The code will be slowly added as it is cleaned up.
The code used can be found in the thesis paper in the appendix. The code uploaded here will be a more unified program with a short explanation. All of this information can be found in the thesis, but this will be significantly more compact.
