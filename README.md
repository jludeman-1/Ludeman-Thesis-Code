# Ludeman-Thesis-Code
The primary code used for the prediction of runway altitude based on four points along the runway edge or two runway corners.
The code will be slowly added as it is cleaned up.
The main methods for the prediction are in the Appendix of the thesis, but will be added here with more in-depth examples.
